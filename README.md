## Notes
2024 Data is incomplete and was included to add some additional research in various charts. Trends will likely be lower due to partial data. 
There was 1 NAN value in the dataset. The data between the 2 months trended downwards so merged_df.bfill()  # Backward fill was used to fill in the data.
