- Matthew Matti

## Research Questions:
1. What was the cost of renting vs homeownership in specific cities in MN?
2. How has it changed from 2018-2023?
3. What are the comparisons from the unique city data gathered from the Minnesota data compared to the National average data?
4. How can we visualize the cost of renting vs. homeownership in specific cities in MN?

### Additional Questions for Future Study:
5. Is urban or rural more cost effective than the other?
6. Is there a correlation between major collegiate schools compared to city size that affects the data?
7. Correlation between age of buyers and renters? Are younger people renting more?
8. Is the homeownership age higher now than in the past?
9. Is there a decrease in homeownership in elderly households?
10. Income of homeownership vs renting – what is the median income of households depending on family size.
11. Homeownership vs renting – based on education level.
12. Annual tax amount w/homeownership and mortgage amount.
13. Rent – (includes property taxes to building owner).
14. Income and ages of homeowners.

## Project Description/Outline
- Specific APIs – ZORI and ZHVI on Zillow (Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) and Zillow Home Value Index(ZHVI))
- Comparing Renting vs Buying (interest included)
- In Minneapolis, Duluth, Rochester and the USA average for both renting and home ownership for each during 2018 - 2023.
- Trending over 5 years 

## Steps:
1. Create a repo – Britta - done
2. Data cleaning for Zillow – Luis – end of class Tuesday 11/12 - done
3. Define elements that are most important to us to tell the story? – end of class Tues 11/12
4. What analysis/functions are we going to run? – Jenna – end of class Thursday 11/14
5. Statistical analysis – Britta – end of class Thursday 11/14
6. Make visualizations of data and numerical correlations – Matthew – End of class Monday 11/18
7. Summarize and conclude data through presentation – Jenna – end of class Monday 11/18

## Tips:
Start with cleaning the first 100 rows to get started so the code, statistical analysis, and following steps can get started.
Consult the README.md file. Some nuiances were discovered that we attempted to document and work around. 
We concluded that interest would be paid whether added into rental prices, or  mortgage payments which we have accounted for. 

## Visuals:
We hope to engage everyone in the visualizations we have compounded that show our findings on the cost benefit analysis of owning or renting a property.
